# NCAA Pitch Classification Model

## Overview
This project focuses on developing and optimizing a pitch classification model to identify different types of baseball pitches for college baseball players. I compared four machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees.

## Project Steps
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered and preprocessed datasets.
Model Implementation: Implemented KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, and Decision Trees using Python.
Model Evaluation: Compared models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimization: Fine-tuned hyperparameters and applied feature engineering to optimize the best model.

## Results
Achieved significant accuracy improvements, aiding in better decision-making for coaches and analysts.

## Tools
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.

## Usage
Refer to the code and notebooks for detailed implementation and results.
